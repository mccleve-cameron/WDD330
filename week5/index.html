        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript, if an error occurs, an exception
            will be thrown that will cause the program to terminate</p>
        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
        <p>Strict mode is a setting that can be added to a file that forces perfrect syntax.
            For example a variable must be declared before a value can be assigned.<br>
            To use strict mode all you need to do is type "use strict";
            at the top of the JavaScript file.
        </p>
        <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
        <p>Linting tools are just built in tools inside of most editors. Often these
            tools will predict if a variable is incorrect, spelled wrong, or just wrong syntax.
        </p>
