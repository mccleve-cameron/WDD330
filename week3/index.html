        <ul>
            <li>A function that is the property of an object is called its method.</li>
            <li>When a method needs to access information inside an object the 
                keyword 'this' is used. It goes before the dot: this.name.
            </li>
            <li>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the 
                language by wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces {}.</li>
        <li>JSON=JavaScript Object Notation is a data storage that serializes
            and configures data. It is represented with a string.
        </li>
        <li>The parse method can be used to convert from JSON to a JavaScriptobject, and 
            stringify does the opposite.
        </li>
        <li>Everything on a webpage is represented by a node.</li>
