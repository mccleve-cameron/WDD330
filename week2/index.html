        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>
            Single line comments start with // and finish at the end of the line: <br>
            <span style="color: green;">// this is a short comment</span> <br>

            Multiline comments start with /* and finish with */:<br>
            <span style="color: green;">/* This is a longer comment anything
                here will be ignored This is a useful place to put notes *</span>
        </p>
        <h3>Syntax</h3>
        <p>Semicolons are not required because of Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI).
            It will try and place semicolons at the end of lines. However it can cause
            errors, so its porbably best to be safe and add them. </p>

        <p>Dot Notation<br>
            name.length; -returns number of characters in a string<br>
            <br>
            Bracket Notation<br>
            name['length']; -also returns the number of characters.</p>

        <h3>Converting Strings to Numbers</h3>
        <p>To covert a string into a number we can multiply a numerical string by 1, which will convert it into a number
            because of type coercion:
            answer = "5" * 1; = 5<br>
            Yet another way to convert a string into a number is to use the Number function:
            Number("23"); = 23</p>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <p>arrays can be declared by typing just square brackets '[]'<br>
            Items can be added to an array by doing; pizza[0] = pepperoni<br>
            Items can be removed by doing; delete pizza[0];<br>
            .shift and .unshift add and remove items from the bottom/front of the array<br>
            join() method takes an array and makes them into a long string.</p>

        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions are delcared using the key word function, then variable name, then parenthesis.<br>
            Functions are first-class objects, they behave the same as any value. A function passed as and
            argument is called a callback.</p>

            <h2>Code Examples</h2>
            <p>Right under this the JavaScript creates an array and then creates a'li' 
                tag to display the names in the array</p>
                <h4>Names in the array are;</h4>
